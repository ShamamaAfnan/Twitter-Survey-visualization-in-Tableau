# Twitter-Survey-visualization-in-Tableau
This Tableau story is a visualization of the 2018 Twitter Survey, the data from which Pew Research Center has generously made freely available to download. The visualizations of the data are presented in three dashboards: a dashboard for user demographics to help us better understand the data, a dashboard for survey responses, and a feeling thermometer dashboard to study user feelings towards a variety of groups that are connected to each other via a Tableau story.
